        Here’s a list of job responsibilities that a coder typically takes on:
      </p>

      <br />

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li className="">
          Write and develop in-house software programs that are fully functional

          Solve problems by collaborating with teams and producing unique
          solutions
        </li>
        <li className="">
          Perform regular audits to identify any inefficiencies and resolve them
          immediately
        </li>
        <li className="">
          Raise any concerns with the manager and report issues
        </li>
        <li className="">
          Regularly write and update technical documents for internal and

        Is coding a stressful job?
      </h1>

      <img

      <p className="">
        In general, coding is a fairly relaxing job.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is the flexibility of working remotely as a programmer, and in
        many cases there is the security of routine.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, as with any job, whether coding is stressful depends largely on
        the company you work with. Cultural pressures and tight deadlines can
        cause stress. Working from home isn't always glamorous either; isolation
        and lack of external motivation can lead to burn out. It's easy to get
        stuck and lost in your head, and when you don't have external
        motivators, it can be easy to want to quit.
        <br />
        <br />
        Moreover, the sedentary lifestyle of sitting down in front of a computer
        all day may pose health risks if you don't exercise—it's a different
        kind of stress.

        What Skills Do Coders Need?

      <p>
        There’s a variety of skills that coders need in order to do their job
        correctly.
        <br />
        <br />
        These can be divided into hard skills and soft skills.
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            Hard skills are those career-specific skills you need to perform the
            essential responsibilities of your job.
          </li>
          <li>
            Soft skills are more personality-based and determine how you work by
            yourself and with others.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Here are some of the skills that a coder needs to have.

        What does a day usually look like for a programmer?
      </h1>

      <img
        className="mb-10 rounded-xl"
        src="https://blogs.sap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/program_sap_li_1034299.jpg"
        alt="image"
      />

      <p className="">
        (This can very wildly, so take this with a grain of salt.)
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        So your day might break down like this:
        <br />
        <br />
        9 am: Come in, check emails, arrange short, medium and long-term to-do
        lists, organise meetings
        <br />
        <br />
        10 am: Standup meeting, coordinate day and organise collaboration (if
        any)
        <br />
        <br />
        Then it’s into project work: Carry out coding, problem-solving and
        development. At various points, you will ask for advice (or give
        advice). Depending on the environment, you might chat or send a message
        via Slack or IRC (a form of chat popular among software devs). If
        members of your team are free, you might go to a whiteboard together or
        sit together and then diagram and work out a solution. (Then you might
        possibly go back to struggling!)
        <br />
        <br />
        Depending on the company, after you find a solution, you’d usually
        create a “change request” or “pull request” summarising changes
        proposed, which someone else would review. They might have ideas or
        solutions of their own.
        <br />
        <br />
        This would probably bring you to lunch. Often, the afternoon is when
        meetings are held, and longer-term projects are discussed.
        <h2 className="text-black text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-5">
          Afternoon and Project Launches
        </h2>
        When launching a new project, you’re given a list of requirements, and
        then you would have to create a design document. That’s usually a 2-3
        page doc describing the problem and proposed solution.
        <br />
        <br />
        Usually, you would say how you’re approaching the issue, and you would
        discuss other alternatives you have considered and why you rejected
        them. You would pitch it to your manager and the rest of the team. For
        these bigger issues or projects, you’d get the go-ahead before you
        start, and you’d know you’re taking an approved approach and that people
        are on board with your ideas.
        <br />
        <br />
        Depending on the company, after you change your features, then you would
        usually (alone or with a colleague) deploy the project to production. At
        this stage, even assuming you’ve tested it rigorously, make sure it runs
        on your own work computer: You might discover issues after deployment,
        and you’d have to address bugs based on feedback from colleagues and
        users/customers.
        <h2 className="text-black text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-5">
          End of Day
        </h2>
        How and when your working day ends depends on your employer: It’s
        usually after the traditional 8 hours have elapsed, but at “crunch time”
        for projects, you might be required to stay until you’ve finished a
        specific task.
        <br />
        <br />
        It might not look very entertaining, but trust me, when you manage to
        solve those hard problems and to overcome the challenges that come with
        your project in order to finish the product in such a way that
        everything works smoothly, it may just be the best feeling in the world.

        Programming has been a hot topic for some time. In a world that runs on
        technology, programming skills offer excellent career options. Computer
        programming is also one of the most flexible careers; it offers many
        specialization opportunities, the ability to work remotely, and more.
        <br />
        <br />
        It can be perceived as being analytical, scientific, precise. It’s some
        of that, but it’s more than that.
        <br />
        <br />
        It requires inspiration, creativity, thoughtfulness, and skill. It
        requires shaping code into works of art that can stand the test of time.
        Maybe programmers and painters are a lot more alike than we think.
